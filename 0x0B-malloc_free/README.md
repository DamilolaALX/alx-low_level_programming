DESCRIPTION:
This repository contains C programs and functions that demonstrate the use of dynamic memory allocation in C using malloc and free functions. Dynamic memory allocation is a crucial concept in C programming that allows you to allocate and deallocate memory as needed during program execution. This project serves as a practical introduction to these concepts.
REQUIREMENTS:
To compile and run the programs in this repository, you will need:
A C compiler (e.g., gcc)
A Unix-like operating system (Linux or macOS is recommended)

USAGE:
Follow these steps to compile and run the programs in this repository:

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/DamilolaALX/0x0B-malloc_free.git

Change to the project directory:
cd 0x0B-malloc_free

Compile the C programs using your preferred C compiler. For example, to compile a program named program.c, use:
gcc -o program program.c

Run the compiled program:
./program

FILE DESCRIPTIONS:
0-create_array.c: a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.

1-strdup.c: a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

2-str_concat.c:  a function that concatenates two strings.

3-alloc_grid.c: a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

4-free_grid.c: a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.
