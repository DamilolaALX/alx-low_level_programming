0x0C-more_malloc_free

DESCRIPTION
This project is part of the ALX software engineering curriculum and aims to expand your understanding of dynamic memory allocation in C by implementing custom memory allocation and deallocation functions. In this project, we'll introduce additional memory management functions and delve deeper into memory allocation strategies.

REQUIREMENTS
To run and test the code in this project, you will need:
* A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
* Standard C library

USAGE
To utilize the custom memory allocation functions in your C program, follow these steps:

Include the main.h header file in your C source file.
#include "main.h"

Use the custom allocation functions more_malloc() and more_calloc() to allocate memory dynamically.
void *ptr = more_malloc(size);

When you're done with the allocated memory, free it using the custom more_free() function.
more_free(ptr);

FILE DESCRIPTIONS
Here's a brief description of the files included in this project:

* main.h - This header file contains function prototypes and necessary includes for custom memory allocation functions.
* 0-malloc_checked.c - A function that allocates memory using malloc.
main.c - An example usage of the custom memory allocation functions in a simple C program.
README.md - This README file with project documentation.

COMPILATION
To compile the code, use the following command:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o my_program

TESTING
You can test the custom memory allocation functions by running the provided main.c program after compilation. Execute the program with the following command:
./my_program
