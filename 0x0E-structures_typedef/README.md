# [0x0E-structures_typedef](https://github.com/DamilolaALX/alx-low_level_programming/0x0E-structures_typedef)

## DESCRIPTION

This repository contains C source code and header files related to working with structures and typedef in C programming.

### FILES

1. [dog.h](https://github.com/DamilolaALX/alx-low_level_programming/0x0E-structures_typedef/blob/main/dog.h): This header file contains the structure definition for `struct dog`, which represents information about a dog, and prototypes for related functions.

2. [1-init_dog.c](https://github.com/DamilolaALX/alx-low_level_programming/0x0E-structures_typedef/blob/main/1-innit_dog.c): This C file defines a function `init_dog` that initializes a `struct dog` with provided values for its members.

3. [2-print_dog.c](https://github.com/DamilolaALX/alx-low_level_programming/0x0E-structures_typedef/blob/main/2-print_dog.c): This C file defines a function `print_dog` that prints information about a `struct dog`.

4. `4-new_dog.c`: This C file defines a function `new_dog` that creates a new `struct dog` with dynamically allocated memory and initializes its members.

5. `5-free_dog.c`: This C file defines a function `free_dog` that frees the memory allocated for a `struct dog`.
