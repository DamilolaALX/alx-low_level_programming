# [0x0D-preprocessor](https://github.com/DamilolaALX/alx-low_level_programming/0x0D-preprocessor)

## DESCCRIPTION

This repository contains C source code and header files related to the use of preprocessor directives in C programming.

### FILES

1. [`0-object_like_macro.h`](https://github.com/DamilolaALX/alx-low_level_programming/0x0D-preprocessor/blob/main/0-object_like_macro.h): Defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

2. [`1-pi.h`](https://github.com/DamilolaALX/alx-low_level_programming/0x0D-preprocessor/blob/main/1-pi.h): Defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

3. [`2-main.c`](https://github.com/DamilolaALX/alx-low_level_programming/0x0D-preprocessor/blob/main/2-main.c): A C program that demonstrates the use of the macros defined in `0-object_like_macro.h` and `1-pi.h`.

4. [`3-function_like_macro.h`](https://github.com/DamilolaALX/alx-low_level_programming/0x0D-preprocessor/blob/main/3-function_like_macro.h): Defines a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

5. [`4-sum.h`](https://github.com/DamilolaALX/alx-low_level_programming/0x0D-preprocessor/blob/main/4-sum.h): Defines a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of two numbers `x` and `y`.
