#[0x10-variadic_functions](https://github.com/DamilolaALX/alx-low_level_programming/0x10-variadic_functions)

##DESCRIPTION:
This project contains C programs that demonstrate the usage of variadic functions. Variadic functions are functions that can take a variable number of arguments.

###FILES
[0-sum_them_all.c](https://github.com/DamilolaALX/alx-low_level_programming/0x10-variadic_functions/blob/master/0-sum_them_all.c): This file contains a function sum_them_all that calculates the sum of a variable number of integers using a variadic function.

1-print_numbers.c: This file contains a function print_numbers that prints a variable number of integers using a variadic function.

2-print_strings.c: This file contains a function print_strings that prints a variable number of strings using a variadic function.

3-print_all.c: This file contains a function print_all that prints a variable number of different types of data (integers, floats, and strings) using a variadic function.

Compilation
To compile any of the programs, you can use a C compiler like gcc. For example:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 0-sum_them_all.c -o sum_them_all
Replace 0-sum_them_all.c with the appropriate file name to compile other programs.

Usage
To use the compiled programs, run the executable generated during the compilation step. For example:

./sum_them_all
Follow the instructions or incorporate the functions in your own code as needed.
